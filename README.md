# Image-generation-Using-Stable-diffusion-and-ComfyUI
This project is part of the Edunet AICTE Tekshsaksham foundation 

# Overview
Stable Diffusion is a state-of-the-art deep learning model used for AI-generated images.The pre-trained diffusion models required to generate high-quality images. These models can be obtained from the Hugging Face model hub or from open-source repositories.

ComfyUI provides a graphical user interface that allows users to create complex workflows for generating, modifying, and enhancing images.The primary software used to build and experiment with custom workflows for image generation. 

## Project Goals
Implement and experiment with Stable Diffusion models for generating high-quality images.
Utilize ComfyUI for an interactive and node-based workflow to customize image outputs.
Explore fine-tuning, control mechanisms, and image-to-image generation
